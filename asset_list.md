That's an excellent step! Having a clear asset list helps tremendously in planning the visual and auditory experience of your PWA, "CAP." It also gives you a checklist for what needs to be created or sourced.

Here's a comprehensive asset list, keeping in mind "Camp Freedom from Carbondale PA," the "CAP" app name, and the various features we've discussed (Bingo, event info, donations, partners):

---

**Next Steps for You Regarding Assets:**

*   **Source or Create:** You'll need to either design these assets yourself (e.g., in graphic design software like Figma, Canva, Photoshop, or GIMP) or commission a graphic designer.
*   **Optimal Formats & Sizes:** When you have the assets, ensure they are optimized for web use (compressed, appropriate dimensions) to ensure fast loading times for your PWA.
*   **Organization:** Store them in a well-structured folder system within your GitHub repository (e.g., `assets/images/`, `assets/icons/`, `assets/sounds/`).

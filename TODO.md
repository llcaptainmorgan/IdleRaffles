### To-Do List: Event Engagement System (PWA for Bingo Raffle)

#### 1. Creating the Bingo Game
**Objective:** Build a functional, engaging Bingo game within the PWA, ensuring it’s modular and reusable.

- [ ] **Develop the Bingo Game Logic (HTML, JavaScript, CSS)**  
  - Write HTML/CSS for the Bingo card UI (5x5 grid, clean design, mobile-friendly).  
  - Implement JavaScript logic for:  
    - Generating unique Bingo cards tied to a `card_id`.  
    - Automatically marking numbers as they’re drawn (via WebSocket updates).  
    - Detecting winning patterns (e.g., row, column, diagonal).  
  - Ensure the game is an **instance-based module** (e.g., a JavaScript class like `BingoGame`) to allow multiple cards per user and easy integration into the PWA.  
  - **Tools:** Use vanilla JavaScript or a lightweight framework like React for modularity.  
  - **Priority:** High (core feature).

- [ ] **Integrate WebSocket for Real-Time Updates**  
  - Set up WebSocket client in the PWA to receive live number draws from the server.  
  - Implement retry logic for connection drops (e.g., exponential backoff).  
  - Display a “network error” dropdown widget for connectivity issues.  
  - **Tools:** Use `WebSocket` API or a library like `Socket.IO` for simplicity.  
  - **Priority:** High (ensures real-time engagement).

- [ ] **Implement Offline Functionality**  
  - Cache Bingo card state in `localStorage` or `IndexedDB` for offline access.  
  - Sync with server when connectivity is restored (fetch missed numbers, update UI).  
  - **Tools:** Service Workers for caching, `localStorage` for simplicity.  
  - **Priority:** Medium (enhances resilience).

#### 2. Creating the Login System
**Objective:** Build a secure, anonymous login system using QR codes and manual codes for attendee access.

- [ ] **Generate Unique Card IDs and QR Codes**  
  - Write a script to pre-generate unique `card_id`s (e.g., `OP987AM`) and corresponding QR codes before the event.  
  - Store these in a backend database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB) as an “index file” mapping `card_id` to Bingo card(s).  
  - Ensure QR codes link to the PWA URL with a query parameter (e.g., `https://yourpwa.com/login?card_id=OP987AM`).  
  - **Tools:** Use a QR code library like `qrcode.js` or a backend library like `python-qrcode`.  
  - **Priority:** High (core access mechanism).

- [ ] **Build Login Page in PWA**  
  - Create a simple UI for QR code scanning (using a library like `jsQR`) or manual code entry.  
  - Validate `card_id` against the backend database to grant access to the user’s Bingo card(s).  
  - Ensure secure session management (e.g., short-lived JWT tokens for anonymous sessions).  
  - **Tools:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, a QR scanning library.  
  - **Priority:** High (user entry point).

- [ ] **Secure Staff Login**  
  - Create a separate staff login page (e.g., `https://yourpwa.com/staff`) with username/password authentication.  
  - Store credentials securely using environment variables or a hashed database (e.g., bcrypt).  
  - **Never hardcode credentials** in the codebase to avoid security risks.  
  - **Tools:** Node.js for backend, bcrypt for password hashing.  
  - **Priority:** Medium (staff functionality).

#### 3. Creating the PWA (Hub Site)
**Objective:** Develop a user-friendly, deployable PWA with a central hub and modular sections.

- [ ] **Set Up GitHub Repository**  
  - Create a GitHub repo for the project (e.g., `event-engagement-pwa`).  
  - Structure folders: `/client` (PWA frontend), `/server` (backend), `/docs` (notes).  
  - Use GitHub Projects for task tracking (e.g., Kanban board).  
  - **Priority:** High (project foundation).

- [ ] **Build the Hub Page**  
  - Design a clean, mobile-first hub page with sections:  
    - **Current Games Live:** List active Bingo games.  
    - **Bingo Game Section:** Link to the Bingo game page.  
    - **Event Information:** Static pages for schedules, FAQs, maps.  
    - **Donation Section:** Sub-pages for partner organizations with donation forms.  
  - Use responsive CSS (e.g., Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap) for a polished look.  
  - **Tools:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, optional framework (React/Vue).  
  - **Priority:** High (user-facing entry point).

- [ ] **Configure PWA Features**  
  - Add a `manifest.json` for home screen installation.  
  - Implement Service Workers for offline caching of static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images).  
  - Enable push notifications for win alerts (optional, if supported by event needs).  
  - **Tools:** Workbox for Service Workers, Web Push API.  
  - **Priority:** Medium (enhances user experience).

- [ ] **Set Up Backend Server**  
  - Create a backend to handle:  
    - Anonymous user management (card IDs, Bingo cards).  
    - Game logic (random number draws, win detection).  
    - Event log (timestamped record of draws, activations, wins).  
    - Staff operations (card activation, win verification).  
  - Host on a reliable cloud provider (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS).  
  - **Tools:** Node.js/Express, SQLite or MongoDB for database.  
  - **Priority:** High (core functionality).

#### 4. Staff Interface
**Objective:** Build a secure, simple interface for staff to manage operations.

- [ ] **Develop Staff Dashboard**  
  - Create a web-based dashboard (accessible via `/staff`) for:  
    - Scanning QR codes to activate cards.  
    - Viewing the event log (filterable by “pending verification”).  
    - Verifying wins and marking prizes as claimed (record winner’s name verbally).  
  - Ensure mobile compatibility for use on tablets/phones.  
  - **Tools:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, backend API endpoints.  
  - **Priority:** Medium (staff efficiency).

- [ ] **Implement Manual Fallback for Network Issues**  
  - Prepare a physical Bingo cage and balls for manual draws.  
  - Train staff to log manual draws in the event log (via staff dashboard or paper backup).  
  - Set up a “Raffle Support” station for manual win verification.  
  - **Priority:** Medium (resilience for worst-case scenario).

#### 5. Critical Questions & Answers
**Objective:** Address your deployment and security concerns to ensure a robust, portable codebase.

- **Q1: What’s the best way to make an HTML codebase deployable on other sites?**  
  **Answer:** To make your PWA easily deployable:  
  - **Use a Single Codebase:** Build the PWA as a self-contained frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that communicates with a backend via APIs. This allows the frontend to be hosted anywhere (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).  
  - **Relative URLs:** Avoid hardcoding absolute URLs (e.g., `https://yourpwa.com`). Use relative paths (e.g., `/api/draws`) to ensure the app works regardless of the domain.  
  - **Environment Variables:** Store configuration (e.g., backend API URL) in a `.env` file or build-time variables (e.g., `process.env.API_URL`). This makes it easy to switch domains.  
  - **Static Hosting + CDN:** Host the PWA on a static site host (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) with a CDN for fast delivery. The backend can be hosted separately (e.g., Heroku).  
  - **Dockerize the Backend (Optional):** Package the backend in a Docker container for easy deployment on any server.  
  - **Action Item:** Structure the PWA to use a single `index.html` entry point with client-side routing (e.g., via React Router) for portability.

- **Q2: Is it better to have security through website-hosted sites for the program rather than self-contained security encrypting?**  
  **Answer:** Website-hosted security (e.g., relying on HTTPS and cloud provider security) is generally better for your use case:  
  - **Hosted Security Benefits:**  
    - Cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Netlify) handle SSL/TLS certificates, DDoS protection, and server patching, reducing your maintenance burden.  
    - HTTPS ensures all data (QR logins, WebSocket updates) is encrypted in transit.  
    - Reputable hosts have robust firewalls and monitoring.  
  - **Self-Contained Encryption Risks:**  
    - Implementing custom encryption (e.g., encrypting data client-side) adds complexity and risk of errors, especially for a solo developer.  
    - You’d need to manage key distribution securely, which is challenging for a small team.  
  - **Recommendation:** Use HTTPS (free via Let’s Encrypt or cloud providers) and store sensitive data (e.g., staff credentials) in a hashed database or environment variables. Avoid custom encryption unless absolutely necessary (e.g., for sensitive offline data).  
  - **Action Item:** Configure HTTPS on your hosting provider and use a secure backend database (e.g., MongoDB with authentication).

- **Q3: Will my code break if we use HTML links to process operations? How can we make operations self-contained for easy deployment?**  
  **Answer:** Using HTML links for operations can introduce issues, but they can be mitigated:  
  - **Potential Issues with HTML Links:**  
    - Links that trigger operations (e.g., `<a href="/api/draw">`) can break if the backend URL changes or if the app is deployed on a different domain.  
    - They rely on page reloads, which disrupt the PWA’s single-page app (SPA) experience.  
  - **Making Operations Self-Contained:**  
    - **Use API Calls Instead of Links:** Replace links with JavaScript `fetch` or `axios` calls to backend API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/draw`). This decouples the frontend from specific URLs.  
    - **Client-Side Routing:** Use a library like React Router or Vue Router to handle navigation within the PWA without full page reloads.  
    - **Modular Code:** Write the Bingo game and login logic as reusable JavaScript modules (e.g., ES Modules) that can be imported anywhere.  
    - **Configuration File:** Store API endpoints and other settings in a single config file (e.g., `config.js`) or environment variables.  
    - **Service Workers:** Use Service Workers to cache API responses and handle operations offline, syncing when online.  
  - **Action Item:** Refactor operations to use `fetch` for API calls and implement client-side routing for a seamless PWA experience.

#### 6. Additional Tasks for Resilience
**Objective:** Prepare for worst-case scenarios (network crashes, ties).

- [ ] **Handle Persistent Network Crashes**  
  - Ensure the event log is stored on the server and accessible offline (e.g., via a local database backup).  
  - Train staff on manual fallback procedures (physical Bingo cage, paper logs).  
  - Set up a dedicated staff hotspot or wired connection for the staff dashboard.  
  - **Priority:** Medium (critical for large events).

- [ ] **Implement Tie-Breaking Logic**  
  - Choose a tie-breaking rule (e.g., “First-to-Signal” or “Random Selection”).  
  - Add server-side logic to detect simultaneous Bingo wins and apply the rule.  
  - Display the rule clearly in the PWA’s rules section and event signage.  
  - **Tools:** Backend logic in Node.js, clear UI text.  
  - **Priority:** Medium (ensures fairness).

#### 7. Testing & Deployment
**Objective:** Ensure the system is reliable and ready for production.

- [ ] **Test the PWA**  
  - Test QR code scanning and manual login across devices (iOS, Android, browsers).  
  - Simulate network issues to verify offline functionality and error handling.  
  - Stress-test the backend with many concurrent users (e.g., using tools like JMeter).  
  - **Priority:** High (ensures reliability).

- [ ] **Deploy the PWA and Backend**  
  - Deploy the PWA to a static host (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).  
  - Deploy the backend to a cloud provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk).  
  - Set up a CDN for static assets (e.g., Cloudflare).  
  - **Priority:** High (final step).

### Prioritization
- **High Priority (Do First):** Bingo game logic, login system, hub page, backend setup, deployment. These are the core components needed for a functional system.  
- **Medium Priority:** Staff interface, offline functionality, tie-breaking logic, network crash fallbacks. These enhance resilience and user experience.  
- **Low Priority (Future Enhancements):** Push notifications, advanced analytics, additional raffle games.

### Notes
- Use GitHub Issues or Projects to track tasks and assign deadlines.  
- Regularly commit code to the GitHub repo with clear commit messages.  
- Document the setup process (e.g., in `/docs`) for future reference.  
- Consider using a lightweight framework (e.g., React) for the PWA to simplify state management and routing.
